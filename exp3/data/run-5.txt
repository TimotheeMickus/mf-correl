A theme no Christian need despise .
He rubbed his side as if in pain .
He waved away her offer of payment , said , ` It 's alright , I 'm on my own tonight , acting boss . '

Dint I tell you about them ? ''
She gave them a sunny smile .
He thrust his hand through the messy , russet-colored waves and looked up , his gaze meeting mine .

If you do n't care for the temperature then leave . ''
I lowered the visor in my car , downshifted into the rush hour traffic , and said , `` Meet you at the DMV in ten . ''
`` I had a feeling , '' he said , and I rolled my eyes .
I saw her heavily made-up eyes dart back to someplace over my shoulder and that should have been my first clue that this was n't going to end up all fun and games .
